Reflection on statistics.
We have seen 4 measurements of central tendency (the *average*): mean, median, mode and midpoint.

Do you think one of them is a better measure of central tendency (finding an *average*) than the others?  There are several resources to help you answer this question that can be accessed with a google search on the Internet.

Your assignment is to 
1. Find an article appropriate to your level of understanding that helps you decide if one method is better than the others
2. Think about and describe situations where one measure would be more appropriate/useful than another.
3. Write a paragraph here that discusses your answer.

2/3. Mean, median, mode, and midpoint are all ways of measuring central tendency. None of them can be considered the best, rather each shines in certain areas, and can be misleading in others. Mean is probably the most basic way of measuring central tendancy, and is usually the default for when someone asks for an average of some data set, the mean is very useful when you have a continuous data set with very few outliers, but it struggles when data sets are skewed or spread out. The median is usually considered the most robust way of measuring central tendancy because it is not affected by the relative size of outliers like mean and midpoint are, but is still effective in finding the central tendancy of a data set. Being unnafected by the size of outliers is both the medians greatest strength and weakness because it allows you to ignore outliers when you dont want to include them, but also forces you to ignore them when they should be included. A great use of median is looking at the central tendancy for the incomes of a group of people, we can use median to look at the amount a normal person would be making without the results gettign skewed by the few people who make a ton of money. Mode is still a very useful way of measuring central tendancy, but is less common than mean or median. It can help to identify a specific point in your data set that is the most common, but that point could come anywhere in your dataset, making it very situational. An example of where we could use mode is a clothing company looking at sales of shirts by size to decide what sizes they should restock. Midpoint is the least common of the four forms because it is generally not considered robust. This is because it only takes into account the largest and smallest numbers in a dataset which makes it extraordinarily suceptable to being skewed by outliers. It can be used in some situations where there is a low sample size, and no outliers.
